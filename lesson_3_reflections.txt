git remote - lists the remotes in the working directory
git remote add *name* *url* - creates a remote
git remove -v - a more verbose list of remotes
git push *gitrepos* *branch* - pushes the branch and all changes into the git repos
git pull *gitrepos* *branch* - pulls the branch and all changes into your local repos

Reflections:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your repository or collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Having Git automatically stay up to date could be detrimental
because you might not want to update your repository yet. Being
able to manually pull changes allows much more flexibility in that sense.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

Forks clone a repository from another user on GitHub to your GitHub.
Clones clone a repository to your computer.
Branches are commits that have more than 1 parent
