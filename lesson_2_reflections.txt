git init - Creates a repository at the working directory
git status - prints the status of the repository at the working directory

Reflections:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A file called .git is created which contains the repository. This needs
to be done in order to make commits and check the status of the repository.
Without it, git will be unable to tell if the files are tracked.
